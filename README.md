WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a learning project where I am developing a 2D platformer and action-adventure game inspired by *Hollow Knight*, built using Unity. The project serves as a hands-on experience to explore game development concepts such as level design, AI behavior, and sprite integration, animation and more.

The game is currently in development, and this repository contains the project files and assets.

### Features
- Gameplay Mechanic:
  - 2D platformer mechanics including movement, jumping, and dashing.
  - Basic combat system
  - Level design that encourages exploration and discovery.
- AI-controlled enemies with custom behaviors such as roaming, attacking, chasing.
- Player health, mana, and ability system that unlock as the game progress.
- Map and enviroment inspired by Hollow Knight.

### Technologies & Tool used
- Unity LTS version 2022.3.24f1.
- C#: Programming language for gameplay mechanics.
- Aseprite: Sprite design and animation.
