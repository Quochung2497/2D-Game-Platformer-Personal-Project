# 2D-Metroidvania-itimidate-Hollow-knight-project
WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a learning project where I am developing a 2D platformer and action-adventure game inspired by *Hollow Knight*, built using Unity. The project serves as a hands-on experience to explore game development concepts such as level design, AI behavior, and sprite integration,..etc.

For those interested in *Hollow Knight* sprites, you can find resources below:  
- **Hollow Knight Sprites (Voidheart Edition) 1.4.3.2:** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lx02_w9TFTYdR3aggI1gbXcLr69roaNV)
